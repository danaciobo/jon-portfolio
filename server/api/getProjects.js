Naked bound, with fold over outer cover and using several paper stocks and fold out feature pages, the book reflected the different layers, spaces, forms, functions and aesthetic components that architecture contains. It’s ethos: ‘Explore Engage Excite,’ acts as a mantra throughout the book, reflecting not only what the book aimed to achieve, but also the architecture team itself.","category":"Design","images":["https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501573/n5fovgopkfszkp7yckyf.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501573/pgrq64c3pbqmhnhadwso.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501573/oukoxjkyvu0kgvpo42a0.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501574/w742fgouswjgyelpvtsa.jpg"],"__v":0,"preview_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1714118233/l6yodek5feknhdyvrvxx.jpg"},{"_id":"6612b3c14b23e947d0b2174a","title":"31 GREAT GEORGE STREET","description":"Building branding, wayfinding and original wall art created as part of the complete refurbishment of a Bristol office building. A new visual identity was developed to integrate with the warehouse/industrial feel of the interior of the building and to appear unobtrusive and sympathetic to the architecture. A logo was created for signage and promotion, along with a library of clean, stripped back icons to be used in wayfinding. Original artwork was produced and applied as super graphics in the basement parking area, and for the atrium walls where it was rendered in Armourcoat plaster.","category":"Design","images":["https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501695/a217fjbcoouwmgqjlfjn.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501694/nqzlqhzyrbueudx2xzgg.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501695/g52wamgs2j2aygz6b1ge.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501692/tsujupdy93ptutzbyocn.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1712501692/rcufjl1nomobdz6dt14h.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1714203537/up4leabetdrq3py8miwe.jpg"],"__v":0,"preview_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dt9lltsq3/image/upload/v1713475099/tqphq1fkliobkze7covo.jpg","audio":""},{"_id":"6612b8e14b23e947d0b2175f","title":"OAK SIDE TABLES","description":"A pair of side tables made from recycled oak floorboards.
